&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2nd year B.S. Computer Engineering student at Adamson University. I graduated Senior High School <br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm the eldest daughter among 4 children of Christopher D. Tabligan and Jennifer A. Tabligan.<br>
 My sibling are Jench Marie A. Tabligan 1st year B.S. B.A. major in Marketing also studing at Adamson University; <br>
John David A. Tabligan is in Grade 4; And my last siblings is Chris Asher A. Tabligan Grade 1.<br>

<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love writing &#128156, I'm a news writer in category of Filipino from Elementary to Senior High School. <br>
Unfortunately, in College I desided to stop joining Campus Journalism.
 Even though I stop joining, <br> I still write poem, Feature Writing or News in my free time. My hobby is to write about<br> anything that came up to my mind, 
anything happening to my life, or about my surrounding. 
I love doing it <br> when I'm alone. Sometimes I do it when I'm with my friends or family but I prefer to write when I'm alone.<br>
 Even many people know I write news but I hide it that I can write not only news.<br>
 I can write different genre but I prefer in Filipino. And Also, I hide it to them that this writting makes me feel happy. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if their are talent that I hide it the most that is I'm Flexible. I can do the feet position in ballet the en point,<br>
 even this is a sec only I'm happy I can do it because I never trained to be in ballet. Also, I can touch the back of my head 
<br>with my feet. Even I notice since I was young that I have a talent to this but never tell to anyone. Not until, I become <br> bored and I accedentally tell to my sibling about my hidden talent.
